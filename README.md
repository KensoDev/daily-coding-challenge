# Daily Coding Challenge

I want to go through a daily coding challenge for educational purposes.

On my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/kensodev) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuFT6CtDnOGvcn9WdAvBusA/), I go through interviews and coding challenged with engineers that want to be hired and want to practice interviewing.

I subscribed to a website called [dailycodingproblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) and I want to go through as many of these as I can.

I will try to do it daily but I can't make any promises.

Feel free to file issues, PRs or any other form of feedback if you want more information.


## Repo structure

Directory for every date I did a problem.

Most problems I will likely solve with Python/JS/Golang.

I will go through the problems with testing in most cases.
